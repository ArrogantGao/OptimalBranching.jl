    MISReducer

A struct representing a reducer for the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. 
This struct serves as a specific implementation of the `AbstractReducer` type.

    problem_reduce(p::MISProblem, ::MISReducer, TR::Type{R}) where R<:AbstractResult

Reduces the given `MISProblem` by removing vertices based on their degrees and returns a new `MISProblem` instance along with the count of removed vertices.

# Arguments
- `p::MISProblem`: The problem instance containing the graph to be reduced.
- `::MISReducer`: An instance of the `MISReducer` struct.
- `TR::Type{R}`: The type of the result expected.

# Returns
- A tuple containing:
  - A new `MISProblem` instance with specified vertices removed.
  - An integer representing the count of removed vertices.

# Description
The function checks the number of vertices in the graph:
- If there are no vertices, it returns a `NoProblem` instance and a count of 0.
- If there is one vertex, it returns a `NoProblem` instance and a count of 1.
- If there are two vertices, it returns a `NoProblem` instance and a count based on the presence of an edge between them.
- For graphs with more than two vertices, it calculates the degrees of the vertices and identifies the vertex with the minimum degree to determine which vertices to remove.
